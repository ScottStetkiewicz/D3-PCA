#### This app is built using `r`, `shiny`, and `FactoMineR`.  It also uses the outstanding [`ScatterD3`](https://github.com/juba/scatterD3) package, which allows for the tooltips, zooming and highlighting seen in the plot.  The code for the PCA was taken from [Vishal Singh's website](https://onsocialtrends.org/politics/state.html#scatterd3), and uses [Chitrasen's](https://github.com/chitcode/assignment) code for the k-Means Clustering.
