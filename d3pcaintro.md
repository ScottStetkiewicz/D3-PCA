#### **This Shiny app is a tool for statistical analyses and visualization of user-input quantitative data.**  

#### Once user data is uploaded into this app and properly formatted, it will be processed using [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).

#### If desired, the output can also be analyzed using [k-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) with the click of a button.  

#### To begin, simply click the 'Analysis' tab on the left-hand panel.
