#### **This Shiny app is a tool for statistical analyses and visualization of user-input quantitative data.**  

#### It was originally part of a larger project developed for evaluating chemical relationships between iron slag samples based on the methodologies outlined in Stetkiewicz (2016).  With the ongoing integration of the [D3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org) and `r`, several new features have become available to enhance the efficiency of exploratory data analysis.

#### Once user data is uploaded into this app and properly formatted, it will be processed using [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).

#### If desired, the output can also be analyzed using [k-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) with the click of a button.  

#### To begin, simply click the 'Analysis' tab on the left-hand panel.
